# Math

The missing Math module for Elixir.

## Installation

Math is [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/math). The package can be installed by:

  1. Add math to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:math, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure math is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:math]]
        end
